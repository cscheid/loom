## Features I want

- microfacets
- instances

### FIXMEs

- my serialization system seems pretty bad, but I don't want to learn
  serde very deeply right now.

- I need a consistency pass on Vec3 vs &Vec3 parameters.

- I need a consistency pass on whether I want to return a box or an object on materials vs scene objects
