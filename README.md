## A Rust Raytracer based on Pete Shirley's "Ray Tracing minibooks"

Seriously, just go buy these books right now, they're U$3.00 each and
worth 10x as much, easily.

I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF WRITING A SCENE FILE FORMAT.

### FIXMEs

- my serialization system seems pretty bad, but I don't want to learn
  serde very deeply right now.

- I need a consistency pass on Vec3 vs &Vec3 parameters.
